		<h3>ID Notes</h3>
			<ul class="customClass">
				<li id="customID">An ID is unique to the element that it's on.</li>
				<li>To target it from our CSS, we need to use a # sign.</li>
				<li>You can use them with classes on the same element</li>

		<h1>IDs versus Classes</h1>
		<h2>IDs</h2>
		<p id="number-one">This ID will be linked in the CSS page by a #</p>
		<p id="number-one number-two">You can't have two IDs on an element.</p>

		<h2>Classes</h2>
		<p class="first-class">One class here</p>
		<p class="first-class second-class">Two classes here</p>

		<p id="number-one">You can use an ID twice, but it's best not to. It should be used mostly for targeting specific items.</p>
